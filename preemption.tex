\section{Model Description}

The Model used in this paper follows the one proposed by \textcite{Olsson2013} rather closely. I adopt most of their formalizations and assumptions. To enable the reader to make use of the derivations in \textcite{Angere2010}, I adopt their notations as well. I summarize the model, describe how I use it for the present purposes and make note of any deviation.

The core entities of the model are \i{agents} and their properties. Agents can be connected to one another, such that they form a network. Since these connections enable communication and the agents are meant to represent people, this structure can be seen as a social network.

The model has certain starting parameters, which I describe below, and discrete timesteps. Each of these enable the update of properties by the rules specified further below.

\subsection{Starting Parameters}

To keep things manageable, there is a single \i{true} target propostion $p$ which the agents have a credence $C^t_\alpha(p)$ towards. Each timestep, agents can receive information from a \i{source}. These can be (i) other agents in the social network or (ii) their own inquiry. The objective chance that an agents inquires and gets it right is called that agent $\alpha$'s \i{aptitude}: $P(S_{\iota \alpha}p \given S_{\iota \alpha} \land p)$, where $S_{\iota \alpha}$ is the chance that agent $\alpha$ inquires for evidence, regardless of the results, and $S_{\iota \alpha} p$ the chance that she inquires and her inquiry yields $p$ as a result. The chance that she inquires at all, $P(S_{\iota \alpha})$, is called her \i{activity}. For the sake of simplicity, these chances are modeled as time invariant.

Sources can be more or less reliable. The reliability is assumed to be symmetric.
\[ 
R_{\sigma \alpha} =_{df.} P(\Ssa p \given \Ssa \land p) = P(\Ssa \neg p \given \Ssa \land \neg p)
\]
This is, of course, just the agent's aptitude. 

Each agent trusts each source to a certain extent. This is expressed in the agent's credence in the reliability of the source:
\[ 
    C^t_{\alpha}(a \leqslant R_{\sa} \leqslant b) = \int_a^b \tau^t_{\sa}(\rho) d\rho
\]
where $\tau^t_{\sa}: [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ is a probability density function such that 
\[
    C^t_{\alpha}(0 \leqslant R_{\sa} \leqslant 1) =  \int_0^1 \tau^t_{\sa} (\rho) d(\rho) = 1
\]which is a very plausible requirement on a rational credence function.\footnote{Add Stuff here about the Olsson and Vallinder Model and how their's is slightly different.}

\begin{description}
    \item[Example.] An agent $\alpha$ with a healthy trust in her own inquisitive abilities and who is not easily swayed in this trust may have a trust function $\tau^t_{\iota\alpha}$ described by a beta distribution
\[
    \tau^t_{\iota\alpha} (\rho) = \frac{1}{B(a,b)} \rho^{a - 1} {(1 - \rho)}^{b-1}
\]
with normalising beta function $B(a,b)$ and parameters $a, b$ chosen such that $\tau^t_{\iota\alpha}$ is densest around whatever a `healthy trust' amounts to, let's say 0.85. (see Fig.\ref{fig1}). Interestingly, the shape of the curve correlates with how resilient the funtion behaves upon updating. More on that below.
\end{description}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering\label{fig1}
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figure_1.png}
	\caption{Example beta distributed trust function with parameters a=LOOK b=UP }
\end{figure}

Apart from inquiries, a source can also be another agent, through testimony. An agent $\alpha$ therefore trusts herself at time $t$ with $\tau^t_{\iota\alpha}$ and another agent $\beta$ with $\tau^t_{\beta\alpha}$.

The exchange of information and the evolution of the trust functions and the credences in $p$ are the most important going-ons in this model, which I'll summarize next.

\subsection{Inquiry and Communication} 

time progess is modeled in discrete steps. At each time step, each agent updates her credence and her trust function. The new information which motivates these changes are messages from the sources, which the agent receives if
\begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*)]
    \item the agent inquires herself with probability $P(S_{\iota\alpha})$. The result of the inquiry is determined by the agent's aptitude. Or,
    \item another agent $\beta$ is connected to agent $\alpha$ through the social network and decides to share her opinion. This is modeled, in slight deviation from the Olsson-Vallinder model, by the following conditions: 
        \begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
            \item Agent $\beta$ is sufficiently confident in $p$ resp. $\neg p$, determined by some faily high threshold value for her credence, and
            \item agent $\beta$ received herself new information in the same time step. In the current implementation, this is only fulfilled by own inquiry.  
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

EXPLAIN why only when new information!!

Testimony is, of course, a matter of language, and is most plausibly modeled as a binary judgment, that is, either $p$ or $\neg p$. While there are certainly interesting cases where the testimony involves credences or levels of confidences, e.g. \ a weather forecaster stating her belief in the chance of rain tomorrow, this does in my view not apply to  

\subsection{General Updating}

Each time step, the agents update their credences and trust functions. Updating the credences is based on new messages the agent received this time step: $\Stsa m^t_{\sa}$, where $m^t_{\sa}$ is the message that $\alpha$ received from $\sigma$ (which can represent $\alpha$'s own inquiry or another agent's testimony) at $t$, and is either $p$ or $\neg p$. An agents can receive multiple messages per time step, but only one message per source, so we have to account for that as well. 

In the central and most important deviation from the Olsson Vallinder model, I distinguish between the \i{Preemption} strategy and the \i{Total Evidence} strategy of dealing with expert testimony. In normal circumstances, both strategies involve the same standard bayesian updating rules, which I give in detail below. In the face of expert testimony they may differ, however, and I describe the requirements for differences as well as the differences themselves subsequently. 

The updating rule is given by conditionalisation:
\[
    C^{t+1}_\alpha (p) = C^t_\alpha (p \given \bigwedge_{\sigma \in \Sigma^t_\alpha} \Stsa m^t_{\sa}),
\]

where $\Sigma^t_\alpha$ is the set of sources that send a message to $\alpha$ at $t$.

With the assumption that sources are independent given the target proposition, the update calculates to
\[
    C^t_\a (p \given \bigwedge \Sm) 
    = \frac{ C^t_\a (p) \prod C^t_\a (\Sm \given p) }
    { C^t_\a (p) \prod C^t_\a (\Sm \given p) +  C^t_\a (\neg p) \prod C^t_\a (\Sm \given \neg p) }.
\]

Here, again, the product and big conjunct range over all sources with a message for the agent, the subscript omitted for legibility.   

The expressions about the reliability are given by:

\begin{align*}
    C^t_\a (\Stsa p \given p) &= C^t_\a (\Stsa) \langle \tau^t_{\sa} \rangle \\
    C^t_\a (\Stsa \neg p \given p) &= C^t_\a (\Stsa) \langle \bar{\tau}^t_{\sa} \rangle \\
    C^t_\a (\Stsa p \given \neg p) &= C^t_\a (\Stsa) \langle \bar{\tau}^t_{\sa} \rangle \\
    C^t_\a (\Stsa \neg p \given \neg p) &= C^t_\a (\Stsa) \langle \tau^t_{\sa} \rangle,
\end{align*}

where $\langle \tau^t_{\sa} \rangle $ is the expected value of trust function $ \tau^t_{\sa} $ and ${\langle \bar{\tau}^t_{\sa} \rangle =_{df.} 1 - \langle \tau^t_{\sa} \rangle}$.\footnote{Detailed and very helpful derivations of these equations can be found in \textcite{Angere2010}, although in places I could not agree with the results. I implemented the updating mechanism as presented in this paper. There is not much room to detail the finer points here, only this much: Angere's final result on page 22 for the credence update intuitively can't be right, since the expression as stated there does not depend on the actual content of the message, that is, $p$ or $\neg p$, anymore, and instead just updates regardless, rendering the network communication ineffective.} 

Upon receiving a message, the agent updates her trust function for that source depending on how well the message coheres with her own credence. The updated trust function can be calculated to
\[
    \tau^{t+1}_\sa = \tau^t_\sa (\rho) \frac{\rho \: C^t_\a (p) + (1 - \rho) C^t_\a (\neg p)}
    {\langle \tau^t_\sa \rangle C^t_\a(p) + \langle \bar{\tau}^t_\sa \rangle C^t_\a(\neg p)}
\]
if $m^t_{\sa} = p$ and 
\[
    \tau^{t+1}_\sa = \tau^t_\sa (\rho) \frac{\rho \: C^t_\a (\neg p) + (1 - \rho) C^t_\a (p)}
    {\langle \tau^t_\sa \rangle C^t_\a(\neg p) + \langle \bar{\tau}^t_\sa \rangle C^t_\a(p)}
\]
if $m^t_{\sa} = \neg p$. This entails that the trust an agents brings towards a source only changes with regard to the agents credence in p and the source's message whether p. This is one of the major shortcomings of the model, in my view, especially for the current purposes, as at no stage something like higher order evidence about the reliability of the source comes into play. 

Insert example with trust function development?

\subsection{Updating With Preemption}

In certain cases, an agent who pursues the preemptive strategy differs in her updating rule from what is described above, namely when she recognizes another agent as an epistemic authority. I modeled Constantin and Grundmann's requirements for the recognition of an epistemic authority in the following way. 
\begin{description} 
    \item[Epistemic Authority] An agent $\alpha$ recognizes another agent $\beta$ as an epistemic authority regarding proposition $p$ at time $t$ if and only if  
    \begin{enumerate}[label= (\roman*)]
        \item $\langle \tau^t_{\beta\alpha} \rangle \geqslant T_A$, where $T_A$ is a reasonably high threshold of trust, and
        \item $\langle \tau^t_{\beta\alpha} \rangle - \langle \tau^t_{\iota\alpha} \rangle \geqslant \Delta_A$, where $\Delta_A$ denotes a significant difference in trust level.
    \end{enumerate}


\end{description}
    In plain English: Consider a layperson and an expert. For the layperson to regard the expert as an epistemic authority, she has to (i) regard the expert with a high amount of trust. The threshold is high, somewhere above .8. Condition (ii) requires that the expert enjoys a significantly higher trust from the layperson than the layperson trusts her own abilities to evaluate evidence. This might also be modeled as a ratio, but in this case is not crucial.

As soon as an agent recognizes another as an epistemic authority, her updating pattern changes significantly. First, she stops to gather evidence herself completely. Second, instead of updating according to all her evidence and sources, she ignores all other messages and instead adopts the authority's opinion.

Constantin and Grundmann do not specify a precise credence as a proper response in this case, as they assume that the layperson knows of the expert's credence. In this model, however, communication happens on a binary basis.
 
I argue that the right credence for the layperson to adopt in this case is just $\langle \tau^t_{\beta\alpha} \rangle$. While it is intuitively appealing, it's also a consequence from some rather innocuous assumptions. The argument goes as follows. 

\textcite[p.12]{Constantin2017} define the effect of preemption as making any evidence for or against the target proposition rationally unusable for the agent. That is, whatever first-order evidence she gathered beforehand, as soon as she recognizes an epistemic authority as such regarding that proposition, two things happen: 

First, she is rationally required to disregard all her evidence. Is is quite uncontroversial to regard a credence around .5 to be rational in the case of total absence of evidence (extreme subjective Bayesians excluded). But being indifferent is certainly not a bad thing in this case. Formally, this can be described as a screening-off. Let $\beta$ be an authority for $\alpha$. Then $\a$'s evidence is preempted by $S_{\beta\a}$ iff for all (relevant) $E$, 
\[ 
    p \CI_{C_\a} E \given S_{\beta\a}$, 
\]
that is, relative to $\a$'s credence function, $p$ is independent of $E$ given $S_{\beta\a}$.



Second, the only available evidence is the authority's testimony. The agent classically conditions on that (see below.) \subsection{Epistemic Value}
